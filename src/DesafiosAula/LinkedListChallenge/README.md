## Instructions
Use the LinkedList functionally to create a list of places, ordered by distace from the starting point.
And we want to use ListIterator to move, both forward and backward, through the list.

First, create a type that has a town name and distance from the starting point,  in this case, the starting point is Sidney.
Create a LinkedList with these towns, ordered by distance.
Sidney should be the first town in the list.

In addtion, create an interative menu to allow the user to:

- Quit
- Move forward to the next town
- Move backward to the previous town
- Show a menu with the options available
- List places in the list, showing the distance from Sidney
